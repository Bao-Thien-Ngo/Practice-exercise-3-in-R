<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
<p align="justify"> 
  This dataset "car_data" was collected in the U.S. and contains information related to cars.

<h2><strong>Questions</strong></h2>
    By using this dataset, I conduct some descriptive analysis, estimate a linear regression model, and answer the following questions:


1. Conceptualize a multiple linear regression model considering “weight” as a dependent variable and a set of independent variables, including binary variables for the model year. Write the regression equation in the document. Briefly explain why you selected those particular independent variables for your model.
2. Present summary statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, first quartile, and third quartile) for the variables in your model in a table and briefly comment on the summaries.
3. Calculate a pairwise correlation matrix for your model variables (while calculating the correlation matrix, only include the dependent variable and the non-binary independent variables that you selected for the model). Present the results in a table and comment on the correlation matrix.
4. Using R, generate your model and follow these steps:
• Calculate VIF for the independent variables of your model and show the values in a table.
• Comment on the multicollinearity issues in your model.
• Avoid multicollinearity issues in your model and re-run the model if necessary.
• Show the final model results in a table.
• Interpret the coefficients in terms of the sign, size (magnitude), and significance.
5. Check the following assumptions of the linear regression model:
• Linearity
• Normality in errors
• Homoskedasticity
• Unusual and influential observations
Present a graphical presentation on each of the assumptions and comment.
6. Do American cars run less mileage per gallon than foreign cars? Use an appropriate statistical test (make sure to write each step and the relevant values in detail in the document).
7. Do the model year binary variables jointly have explanatory power? Use an appropriate statistical test (make sure to write each step and the relevant values in detail in the document).
8. Calculate the model’s goodness of fit and comment.

  
<h2><strong>Note</strong></h2>
These questions are from my teacher's lecture in my class.
